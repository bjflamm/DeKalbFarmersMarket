# DeKalb Farmers Market Redesign
# -
## The primary goal of this project is to improve the overall user experience of the DeKalb Farmers Market’s (DFM) site (dekalbfarmersmarket.com). I’ve broken it into more specific and measurable goals that can be implemented, tested, and improved upon while remaining in a feedback loop 
### •	Improve readability 
  ### Improve readability by paring down content to better highlight and educate consumers on the history and reputation of DFM, its local and global agricultural sourcing, and its current events. 

### •	Improve navigational structure 
  ### Reorganize the navigational structure so that users can accomplish tasks in fewer clicks such as looking up specific vendors, hours of operation, job opportunities, etc. 

### •	Improve website desirability 
  ### Improve the desirability of the site by introducing a theme that is consistent for each section and properly represents the brand of DFM 

### These goals all assume that users are actually being drawn to the site in the first place. Analyzing the DFM’s current marketing outlets, it could draw more users to the website (and ultimately the farmers market) by increasing its social media presence. It has a YouTube channel that hasn’t been updated in 4 years along with multiple reviews and a book written by its founder/owner. By modernizing its social media approach, the DFM could have the potential to significantly increase its overall website and market traffic.
