# Goals
 The primary goal of this project is to improve the overall user experience of the DeKalb Farmers Market’s (DFM) site (dekalbfarmersmarket.com). I’ve broken it into more specific and measurable goals that can be implemented, tested, and improved upon while remaining in a feedback loop:
*	**Improve readability**
    
    Improve readability by paring down content to better highlight and educate consumers on the history and reputation of DFM, its local and global agricultural sourcing, and its current events. 

*	**Improve navigational structure** 
    
    Reorganize the navigational structure so that users can accomplish tasks in fewer clicks such as looking up specific vendors, hours of operation, job opportunities, etc. 

*	**Improve website desirability** 
    
    Improve the desirability of the site by introducing a theme that is consistent for each section and properly represents the brand of DFM

# Site Review and Competitive Analysis
The existing site was evaluated on the following characteristics (followed by their respective scores):
* **Brand and Visual Design - 5 out of 18 possible points**
* **Navigation - 4 out of 18 possible points**
* **Content - 4 out of 12 possible points**
* **Usability - 1 out of 3 possible points**
* **Accessibility - 6 out of 15 possible points**

Competitor sites were also evaluated against the same metrics as the DFM site - the resulting analyses highlighted areas of improvement and implementation possibilities for the wireframing process. Full write-up can be found [here](../..//tree/master/deliverables).
